Windows server application framework

== Building
=== Prerequisites
* CMake >= 3.6
* Visual Studio 2022

=== Steps

[source, shell session]
----
git clone https://github.com/gknowles/dimapp.git
cd dimapp
git submodule update --init
configure.bat
msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /m
----

Instead of running msbuild you can open the build/dimapp.sln solution file 
(generated by configure.bat) in Visual Studio and build it there.

Binaries are placed in dimapp/bin, and can be run from there for simple
testing.
