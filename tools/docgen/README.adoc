= docgen

Markup documentation processing.

== Static website generation
* Assumes documentation sources are stored in a git repository.
* Single configuration file defines how site is generated, looks for
  "&lt;GIT_ROOT>/docs/docgen.xml" by default.
** Can defer file and URL mappings to revision of docgen.xml at each branch/tag
   being generated.
* Allows all markup languages supported by github-markup.
* Syntax highlighting done dynamically by
  https://highlightjs.org[highlight.js].
* Documentation for multiple product versions selectable via dropdown.
* Generates per page table of contents.
* Updates cross references links between pages within each version.
** Versions read from git via list of branch/tag combinations.
* Replaces all contents (except ".git") of output directory with new site
  files.

=== Site file layout
* .nojekyll (so the site can be directly deployed to GitHub)
* index.html (redirect to default version)
* css/docgen.css
* js/ (reserved for future use)
* <version name>/<url>.html
** (for each page defined in the version's layout)

=== Dependencies
* https://git-scm.com[git]
* https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/patch.html[patch]
  (needed if you apply patches to old documentation versions, included in Git
  for Windows)
* https://github.com/github/markup[github-markup]
* https://fontawesome.com[Font Awesome]
* https://getbootstrap.com[Bootstrap]
* https://highlightjs.org[highlight.js]

The others are external dependencies of the generated site, but github-markup
is a ruby gem that must be installed for sites to be generated.

== Code sample verification
* Single docgen.xml file defines how samples are verified.
* Extracts comment and code blocks, with attributes, from documentation markup.
** AsciiDoc
** Markdown - not implemented
* Apply compile and scripting rules defined for the language in docgen.xml.

=== AsciiDoc
Comment (////) and code (----) blocks explicitly marked as source and with a
language are processed. Such as:

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
  [source, C++]
  ----
  int a = 1;
  ----
----

Or with test additional attributes (see <<Attributes in markup, below>>):

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
  [source, C++, test alt, test file not_main]
  ...
----

When a comment block is used, it should be immediately followed by another
block. The comment block will be interpreted by AsciiDoc as a comment between
the attributes and following block. An empty passthrough block works well in
this role.

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
  [source, C++]
  ////
  int a = 1;
  ////
  ++++
  ++++
----

=== Attributes in markup
To enable testing, attributes are added to comment or code blocks to specify
how the extracted code is compiled and tests are run.

<line ranges>:: Space separated series of space separated <start line> and
<length> pairs. The last <length> of the last pair can be left off, in which
case that range extends to the last line.

==== All blocks
* test ignore - ignore this block
* test lang <lang> - overrides code language
* test repl <target line ranges>
* test subset <source line ranges>

==== Program source code
* test alt - save current program as alternate
* test file <name> - apply to one file in program
* test prefix <source line ranges> - set global code file prefix for language

==== Test scripts
* test getline <line> <start pos> - marks keyboard input from user
* test noscript - compile only test, don't try scripts

=== Script.txt format
Each line starts with the type (a single character), a space, and the content
of the line. The types are:

* ; - script file comment
* # - comment about following command line
* $ - command line to execute
* < - stdin sent to preceding command line when it's executed
* > - expected output (stderr and then stdout) from preceding command line
