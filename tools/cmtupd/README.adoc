Update date range in copyright comments to extend to the current year if the
year of the file's last commit time is more recent than what's in the current
copyright comment.

Uses configuration file ($GIT_ROOT/conf/cmtupd.xml by default) to map comment
formats to file extensions, and to exclude specific files.

Operates on files within the current branch of a git repo, this is a safety
feature ensuring that bad changes from bad rules or file errors can always be
reverted.

Auto-generated vars (aka variables):
    $CurrentYear: current year, 4-digits
    $CommitYear: year file was last committed, 4-digits

Lines matched by Match/@regex are replaced with @replace if an update action
is triggered.

The attributes @value, @regex, @replace, @default, @arg1, and @arg2 are
interpreted as simple attribute value templates, where the embraced content is
replaced with the value of the named Var and literal braces must be escaped.
Braces are escaped by doubling them up, so '{{' and '}}' are interpreted as '{'
and '} respectively.
