Update date range in copyright comments to extend to the current year if the
year of the file's last commit time is more recent than what's in the current
copyright comment.

Uses configuration file ($GIT_ROOT/conf/cmtupd.xml by default) to map comment
formats to file extensions, and to exclude specific files.

Operates on files within the current branch of a git repo, this is a safety
feature ensuring that bad changes from bad rules or file errors can always be
reverted.
